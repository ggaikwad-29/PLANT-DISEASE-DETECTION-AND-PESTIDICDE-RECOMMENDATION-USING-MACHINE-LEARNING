# PLANT-DISEASE-DETECTION-AND-PESTIDICDE-RECOMMENDATION-USING-MACHINE-LEARNING
Develop CNN based version to design and develop a sturdy and correct CNN version mainly tailored for crop ailment detection. Achieve high detection accuracy. The objective is to achieve excessive accuracy in detecting crop diseases and providing customized treatment recommendations and personalized therapy tips based at the recognized disease.

#TECHNOLOGIES AND TOOLS TO BE USED:

1)	JUPYTER NOTEBOOK: A Platform through which can access all libraries and use them according to your requirement. It is used to implement your logic. 
2)	SPYDER: Spyder is an integrated development environment (IDE) for scientific programming and data analysis in Python. It provides a powerful environment for developing and running Python code, particularly in the fields of scientific research, data analysis, and machine learning. The version here required is 3.8.16 
3)	PYTHON: Python is a language through which this whole project is made and it is used to create model via Jupyter notebook libraries and also used to create web app. The version here required is 3.8
4)	KERAS: A High-level Deep Learning API to Use Neural Network in Project.
5)	TENSORFLOW: It is used by keras to perform low level operation or as a Backend Engine
